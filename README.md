# Hey, I'm Tony ðŸ¤˜
## I like working on:

- **Systems Software**: Operating Systems, Performance Engineering
- **Infrastructure**: Running software reliably at scale, building tools and automation for large systems, k8s
- Microservice Architecture
- **Security**: AppSec/NetSec/InfoSec
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Go, C/C++


Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on infra/systems projects: data stores, messaging systems, platform tools. Anything that helps a service run, really.

I'd like to get deeper into the Rust and Go communities while still allocating time to work on Python projects as well.
